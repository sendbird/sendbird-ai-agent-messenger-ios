# Changelog

### v0.9.8 (Jun 30, 2025)

### Fixed
- Updated swift-tools-version to 6.1

### v0.9.7 (Jun 30, 2025)

### Fixed
- Improved framework binary compatibility across different Swift versions

### v0.9.6 (Jun 27, 2025)

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Minimum Requirements**: Xcode 16.3+ (Swift 6.1+) now required

#### What Changed
- Updated to Swift 6.1 to resolve Apple's Swift compiler compatibility issues between versions 6.0 and 6.1
- Addresses module interface incompatibility introduced in Swift 6.1

#### Why This Change?
Apple's Swift 6.1 compiler cannot load modules built with Swift 6.0, even with `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION` enabled. This affects users on macOS Sequoia (which requires Xcode 16+) and those using newer Xcode versions.

#### If You See This Error:
```
Failed to build module 'SendbirdAIAgentCore'; 
this SDK is not supported by the compiler
```
**Fix**: Update to Xcode 16.3+, then clean and rebuild your project.
